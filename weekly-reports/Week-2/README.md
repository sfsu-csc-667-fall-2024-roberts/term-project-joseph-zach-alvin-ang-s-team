Description:

    - This week we completed the pdf assigned.

    - We set up the projects board for next week, but did not add one for this week as we mostly did it together.

    - Other than adding the working server we made sure everyone had npm, express, etc... and that we were all on the same version.

    - Corrected a few boilerplate problems that seemed to happen between one person and the next. Specificaly with the cookies-parser and morgan libs.

    - Disccused the rulesets of the git and how the branching system is going to work. (Have not i0mplemented the rulesets yet.)

Other:
No needed suplimentary items this week. Just this description and the server built.
