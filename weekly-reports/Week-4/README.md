Description:

    - We played through the board game in person to note down the interactions

    - We completed the majority of the week 4 pdf

    - Worked through issues with the file routing with an added condition to the tsconfig file complier settings

    - created the SQL code and discussed how we will implement it

    - figuring out how we will be hosting the server and such

    - instead of adding the async db migration we are port forwarding and including a password. 
    
    - This will chnage later when we determine wether or not the port forwarding is the finalized correct approach that we want to do.
    
    - This way when the server starts. The database does not restart as it would if it were migrated. 
    
    - Instead we want to forward the host server to be able to connect to a safe database connect. 
    
    - We chose to do this because we did not want to dance around the port issue with the school so we are linking to a house server.

    - We unfortunatly did not get the graph function created this week so we are doing that next week instead.
    - Instead of using workbench we migrated to psql for easy access to the database.
